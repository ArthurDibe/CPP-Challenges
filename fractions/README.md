# Fractions operations between objects

This solution has the purpose of showing how to implement a fraction operation between objects that hold integers as data members

* `Fraction.h`: This header contains the Fraction class that holds the information for a single fraction and defines the set of admissible operations on a Fraction object.<br>

* `Fraction.cpp`: This module implements the functions declared in the Fraction.h. In here you will find functions and overloaded operators that helps to deal with objects of Fraction type.

# Generic Swap

This section you can find a solution to swap different data types by implementing a templated function called swap.

* `main.cpp`: This module allocate dynamic memory through a function  called initialize and swap variables' contents by calling the templated function swap.<br>

* `Generic.h`: This header conatains a definition of initialize function that will allocate dynamic memory for a char*. In addition implements a templated function that swaps variables, inclusive c-style string variables in a specialization for swap.
